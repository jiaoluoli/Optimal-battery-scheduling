# Optimal-battery-scheduling
Postgraduate dissertation
Use ARIMA-type model to forecast the weather and the power demand, and then use Pyomo to build the optimization model and create the optimal battery storage profiles.

There are three main python files. The forecast.ipynb file contains the codes to train and use the forecast models, also the time series analysis. The optimization model is built in the optimization_works.ipynb file. The compare_result.ipynb is used to compare the effectiveness of the battery storage schedule profiles created by the three kinds of data discussed in section 5.4.
